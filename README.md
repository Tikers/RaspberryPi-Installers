# RaspberryPi-Installers
A number of scripts to easely install some programs on a Raspberry Pi 

These are some of the first scripts I wrote so please feel free to provide me with feedback. Any sugestions or optimalisation is welcome!

I advise you to always read a script before running it!

## Available Scripts
* SABNZB+, a usenet download tool that does almost evrything for you. (Is requirement for some other scripts)
* CouchPotato, automatically download movies when available (requires SABNZB or simulair)
* Sonar, automatically download TV Shows when available (requires SABNZB or simulair)
* HeadPhones, automatically download Music when available (requires SABNZB or simulair)
* Plex, create your own netflix server (warning not all codex run on the PI!)
* MotionEye, a camera management environment. For time laps or security purposes.
